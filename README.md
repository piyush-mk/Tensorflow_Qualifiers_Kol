# Tensorflow Competition Kolkata 2022

A repository made to host the code for the Tensorflow Competition Kolkata 2022. The competition is being held by the Tensorflow User Group Kolkata. The competition is being held on Kaggle. The link to the competition is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tfugkol/overview).<br/><br/>
I have used LightGBM regression for this competition. The notebook with code is [Tflowcomp1](/Notebook_code/Tflowcomp1.ipynb).<br/><br/>
